st.session_state['description'] = '''An eleven-year-old boy (Figure 1, III-1) with a history of vision problems since the age of 4 years was referred to one of the authors (S.J.I.) for evaluation. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/25 OU and both corneas were clear but enlarged with horizontal corneal diameters measuring 15.0 mm OD and 14.5 mm OS (Figure 2A-C). Intraocular pressures were within normal limits and no optic nerve cupping was observed in either eye. At the age of 15 years, he was referred to another of the authors (A.J.A.) for examination and DNA collection. The AVCD measured 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS and slit lamp examination revealed bilaterally enlarged corneal diameters of 14.0 mm OU with no abnormalities of clarity or contour. The anterior chambers were enlarged in depth, measuring 6.34 mm OD and 6.14 mm OS and the central corneal pachymetry was decreased to 463 microns OD and 461 microns OS. Corneal topographic images were normal, with mean keratometry values of 43.9 D OD and 44.0 D OS (figure 2D). Examination of the proband's three younger siblings revealed normal horizontal corneal diameters of approximately 12.5 mm in one (Figure 1, III-2) and increased horizontal corneal diameters of 14.0 mm in two (Figure 1, III-3 and III-4).While central corneal pachymetry was slightly increased in the sibling with normal corneal diameters (604 microns OU), it was decreased in the two affected siblings (466 microns OD and 459 microns OS in III-3; 482 microns OD and 514 microns OS in III-4). Topographic images of the cornea of the unaffected sibling (Figure 1, III-2) showed mean keratometry values of 41.83 D OD and 41.42 D OS, compared to a mean keratometry value of 45.65 OS (no reliable topographic images of the OD cornea could be obtained) in the 6-year-old proband sibling (Figure 1, III-3). Corneal topography was not possible in the 3-year-old sibling of the proband (Figure 1, III-4). Examination of the proband's mother presented no observations.'''
